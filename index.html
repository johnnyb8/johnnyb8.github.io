								<p>I'm 20 years old and I grew up in Ottawa before moving to St. John's for school. I am an active person and spend my spare time hiking, biking, playing <a id="myImg1"><strong>guitar</strong></a>, and playing <a id="myImg"><strong>sports</strong></a> when I have the time.</p>
								<p>Hockey and rugby are my main sports and I was on many successful teams during and after high school.  I played a leadership role as captain and learned how to work as part of a team and also motivate the other members of the team.</p>

								<p>I just completed my second Co-op work term at Nokia networks in Ottawa.  It's a terrific workplace with challenging work and a great team atmosphere. My team provides 3rd level support for Nokia installations around the world using one of their successful enterprise level software solutions entitled NSP NFM-P. I have learned a lot about the product itself, and have also had a chance to hone my problem solving, troubleshooting, and programming skills.  During my time at Nokia I have provided numerous presentations to both peers and management staff about the work I am doing.</p>
								<p>The Ottawa Nokia campus employs about 60 co-op students and I was one of 3 students on the internal Co-op council which Nokia developed to be a voice for the the co-op students. I was also a member of the 3 person co-op team responsible for part of Nokia's United Way fundraiser. </p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/mem.png" alt="" id="memImg" /></span>
								<p>I graduated high school with Honours and was an Ontario Scholar with a French Immersion certificate.</p>
								<p>With an aptitude for science, math and troubleshooting it was a logical decision to pursue a career in engineering.  Recognizing that the future in most industries would be built around automation and computing I chose Computer Engineering as my discipline.</p>
								<p>Choosing Memorial University of Newfoundland (MUN) was an easy decision.  With my sister  completing her Master of Science degree at MUN and my mother being from Newfoundland I had spent a lot of time on the island and I loved it.</p>
								<p>In my first year in residence, I was fully engaged in all activities and actively participated in all of the the engineering d-days!  Although I had a LOT of fun, I did the work and was rewarded with good marks.</p>
								<p>That first year I also provided math tutoring for a local community association and really enjoyed helping the folks there. In second year I was a math tutor again and worked at MUN helping students with their math studies.  It was very rewarding.</p>
