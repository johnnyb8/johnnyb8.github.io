								<span class="image main"><img id="headshot"src="images/john_headshot.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I'm 21 years old and I grew up in Ottawa before moving to St. John's for school. I am an active person and spend my spare time hiking, biking, playing <a class="modal-image js-modal-link" id="guitar-modal-link"><strong>guitar</strong></a>, and playing <a class="modal-image js-modal-link" id="rugby-modal-link"><strong>sports</strong></a> when I have the time.</p>
								<p>Hockey and rugby are my main sports and I was on many successful teams during and after high school.  I played a leadership role as captain and learned how to work as part of a team and also motivate the other members of the team.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Work</h2>
								<div class="workMe" id="particles-js2"></div>
								<span class="image main"><img id="colab-banner" src="images/colab_logo.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I have been working at CoLab Software for the past three months as a full stack developer with a focus on the front end. During this time, I have accomplished a lot, and developed many complex features that add true value to our product, Gradient. I have proven myself to be a highly functioning member of the team, not only as a developer, but someone with good ideas to bring to the table.</p>
								<p>Working for a fast growing start up has been an immensely gratifying experience. </p>
								<span class="image main"><img id="nokiaImg" src="images/nokia_logo.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I completed two Co-op work terms at Nokia Networks in Ottawa.  It was a terrific workplace with challenging work and a great team atmosphere. My team provided 3rd level support for Nokia installations around the world using one of their successful enterprise level software solutions entitled NSP NFM-P. I learned a lot about the product itself, and also had a chance to hone my problem solving, troubleshooting, and programming skills.  During my time at Nokia I provided numerous presentations to both peers and management staff about the work I was doing.</p>
								<p>The Ottawa Nokia campus employs about 60 co-op students and I was one of 3 students on the internal Co-op council which Nokia developed to be a voice for the the co-op students. I was also a member of the 3 person co-op team responsible for part of Nokia's United Way fundraiser. </p>

								<h2 class="major">School</h2>
								<div class="schoolMe" id="particles-js3"></div>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/mun_logo.png" alt="" id="memImg" /></span>
								<p>I graduated high school with Honours and was an Ontario Scholar with a French Immersion certificate.</p>
								<p>With an aptitude for science, math and troubleshooting it was a logical decision to pursue a career in engineering.  Recognizing that the future in most industries would be built around automation and computing I chose Computer Engineering as my discipline.</p>
								<p>Choosing Memorial University of Newfoundland (MUN) was an easy decision.  With my sister  completing her Master of Science degree at MUN and my mother being from Newfoundland I had spent a lot of time on the island and I loved it.</p>
								<p>In my first year in residence, I was fully engaged in all activities and actively participated in all of the the engineering d-days!  Although I had a LOT of fun, I did the work and was rewarded with good marks.</p>
								<p>That first year I also provided math tutoring for a local community association and really enjoyed helping the folks there. In second year I was a math tutor again and worked at MUN helping students with their math studies.  It was very rewarding.</p>
