								<span class="image main"><img id="headshot"src="images/john_headshot.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I'm 21 years old and I grew up in Ottawa before moving to St. John's for school. I am an active person and spend my spare time
									 hiking, biking, playing <a class="modal-image js-modal-link" id="guitar-modal-link">guitar</a>, and playing
									  <a class="modal-image js-modal-link" id="rugby-modal-link">sports</a> when I have the time. My passion for music has ended up
										with me being frontman for my band, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/8stepband/" target="_blank">Eight Step.</a>
								</p>
								<p>Hockey and rugby are my main sports and I was on many successful teams during and after high school.  I played a leadership role
									 as captain and learned how to work as part of a team and also motivate the other members of the team. I believe these early leadership experiences have
									 helped me excel and take on extra responsibility with current teams I'm on.

								<span class="image main"><img id="colab-banner" src="images/colab_logo.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I have been working at <a href="https://www.colabsoftware.com/" target="_blank">CoLab Software</a> for the past 11 months as a full stack developer with a slight focus on the front end.
									 During this time, I have accomplished a lot, and developed many complex features that add true value to our product, Gradient. I have
									 demonstrated my ability to lead in various ways such as taking the lead on pushes to get important features in, and organzing test day at the
									 end of our 2 week sprints.
									  I have proven myself to be a highly functioning member of the team, not only as a developer, but someone with good ideas to bring to the table who can do whatever you need them to.</p>
								<p>Working for a fast growing start up has been an immensely gratifying experience, and I hope to one day either lead a development team or a company of my own. </p>

								<p>I have been a member of the Dalhousie Space Systems Lab for 14 months. We are a team of students, professors, and researchers participating in the
									 <a href="http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/satellites/cubesat/default.asp" target="_blank">Canadian CubeSat Project.</a> Since joining the team I have taken on many tasks such as designing,
									 building, deploying, and maintaining the <a href="http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/satellites/cubesat/default.asp" target="_blank">team website.</a> I have also been a core member of the software
									 team, being resposible for writing C++ code that will run aboard the CubeSat while it is in space. Furthermore, I have put countless hours of reseach into previous CubeSat designs and software systems
									 to ensure we have the best possible satellite. This is a once in a life time opportunity and I am lucky to be a part of it.

								<span class="image main"><img id="nokiaImg" src="images/nokia_logo.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I completed two 4 month Co-op work terms at Nokia Networks in Ottawa.  It was a terrific workplace with challenging work and a great team atmosphere.
									 My team provided 3rd level support for Nokia installations around the world using one of their successful enterprise level software solutions entitled NSP NFM-P.
									  I learned a lot about the product itself and was able to hone my problem solving, troubleshooting, and programming skills on a massive product dealing with important customers.
										  During my time at Nokia I provided numerous presentations to both peers and management staff about the work I was doing.</p>
								<p>The Ottawa Nokia campus employs about 60 co-op students and I was one of 3 students on the internal Co-op council which Nokia developed to be a voice for the the co-op students.
									 I was also a member of the 3 person co-op team responsible for part of Nokia's United Way fundraiser. </p>

								<h2 class="major">School</h2>
								<div class="schoolMe" id="particles-js3"></div>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/mun_logo.png" alt="" id="memImg" /></span>
								<p>I graduated high school with Honours and was an Ontario Scholar with a French Immersion certificate.</p>
								<p>With an aptitude for science, math and troubleshooting it was a logical decision to pursue a career in engineering.  Recognizing that the future in most industries would be built
									 around automation and having a passion for software I chose Computer Engineering as my discipline.</p>
								<p>Choosing Memorial University of Newfoundland (MUN) was an easy decision.  With my sister  completing her Master of Science degree at MUN and my mother being
									 from Newfoundland I had spent a lot of time on the island and I loved it.</p>
								<p>In my first year in residence, I was fully engaged in all activities and was elected as House President for my second year. Although I had a lot of fun,
									 I did the work and was rewarded with good marks. Once I entered my discipline, I was also elected as the Computer Engineering Class Representitive. In this position, I act as an interface between the students and professors,
								 as well as organize all of our class events. It's a lot of work but I love doing it.</p>
								<p>In first year I provided math tutoring for a local community association and really enjoyed helping the folks there. In second year I was a math/chemistry tutor again and worked
									 at MUN helping students throughout the semester.  It was very rewarding.</p>
